On code layout and flow:
An effort is made to maintain the structure of the actual tax forms used by the
IRS, as well as have the logic of the code follow their worksheets and general
flow of the forms. Why change something the government has worked on for
decades?


On variable names:
Variable names are maintained line agnostic. Line numbers tend to change from
year to year, so variable names use the tax form field name. These are often
bolded on the form. In the cases where a field name is not available, an
attempt will be made at a descriptive name. Tax year specific info might be
found in the comments, preppended by something like "2024TY" w/o the quotes.
